# Gesture-Based-MIDI-Controller
This project was created for my final year project at Cardiff University, UK. 

# Description
This project allows the user to map gestures to a CC command that can be used to control a piece of music within an audio workstation.
The program allows for the control of 7 actions per each track along with 2 global controls. In total this allows for 114 possible controls.

# Pre-requisites

* Java (JRE) 1.8
* Leap Motion Controller
* Digital Audio Workstation Software (DAW) - I tested this project with Reaper
